**Experiment:** Compare and contrast different software project estimation and scheduling techniques.

## 1. Aim

To compare software project estimation and scheduling techniques and apply suitable methods to estimate the effort, implementation cost, and timeline for the Placement Finder project.

## 2. Project overview and assumptions

Placement Finder is treated as a web application that helps candidates find placement opportunities. The assumed project scope includes:

- A responsive interface for candidates
- Candidate registration and profile management
- Placement listings with search and filters
- Saved opportunities or an application feature
- An administrator interface to manage listings
- Database and application logic, testing, and deployment

## 3. Estimation techniques: comparison and contrast

Project estimation predicts required work, cost, resources, or duration. Techniques differ in the information they need, the detail they provide, and how much judgment is involved.

| Technique | How it works | Strengths | Limitations | Use for Placement Finder |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Expert judgment | An experienced developer estimates from knowledge of similar work. | Fast and useful early. | Subjective; estimators may disagree. | Initial cross-check of the total. |
| Analogy estimation | Compares with a previous similar project and adjusts for differences. | Simple when reliable examples exist. | The comparison may be inaccurate if project scope differs. | Compare with a similar student job portal or listing site. |
| Top-down estimation | Estimates the whole project, then divides the total among major components. | Quick before detailed requirements are known. | May miss small tasks and integration work. | Early budget and feasibility check. |
| Bottom-up estimation | Estimates individual tasks and sums them. | Detailed, traceable, useful for tracking. | Needs a task breakdown and takes longer. | Main estimate after the feature list is agreed. |
| Function-point or size-based estimation | Measures user-visible functions or software size, then converts this to effort using productivity data or a model. | Relates effort to functionality; can be used before coding. | Needs consistent counting rules and comparable productivity data. | Independent check after counting user functions. |
| COCOMO-style estimation | Uses estimated software size and project factors to calculate effort and schedule. | Structured when calibrated. | Depends on suitable size and calibration inputs. | Use if reliable size and project data are available. |

Top-down and expert-based methods are faster but less detailed. Bottom-up estimation is more transparent once tasks are known. Analogy and size-based methods can check whether the bottom-up result is plausible when suitable comparison data exists.

## 4. Scheduling techniques: comparison and contrast

Scheduling organizes work into activities, dependencies, and calendar dates. It must account for task order and which work can happen in parallel.

| Technique | How it works | Strengths | Limitations | Use for Placement Finder |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gantt chart | Shows tasks as bars across a calendar timeline. | Easy to read and communicate. | Dependencies and risks can be less visible in large plans. | Present the six-week implementation plan. |
| Critical Path Method (CPM) | Finds the longest chain of dependent tasks; a delay on this chain delays the project. | Highlights activities needing close monitoring. | Usually treats task durations as fixed. | Monitor dependencies from requirements through release. |
| PERT | Uses optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic task durations. | Makes uncertainty explicit. | Duration values still rely on judgment. | Estimate uncertain integration and defect-fixing work. |
| Agile iteration planning | Plans short, prioritized sets of work and updates plans using feedback. | Adapts to change and delivers progress frequently. | Finish date is less certain unless scope is controlled. | Deliver a usable core, then refine features. |

A Gantt chart communicates the calendar plan; CPM highlights dependency-driven delays; PERT represents duration uncertainty. Agile iteration planning is useful when requirements may change.

### Project scheduling dependency flow

    A[Requirements] --> B[Design and data model]
    B --> C[Core implementation]
    C --> D[Integration]
    D --> E[Testing and defect fixing]
    E --> F[Deployment and handover]
```

Frontend and backend work can overlap after requirements and the data model are agreed. Integration depends on both streams being ready, so delays in either can affect testing and deployment.

## 5. Applied effort and cost estimate

The bottom-up estimate is the baseline. Rates are planning assumptions in Indian rupees per person-day; they are not a vendor quotation or verified market-rate survey.

| Work area | Effort | Assumed rate per person-day | Estimated cost |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Requirements and analysis | 5 days | ₹2,500 | ₹12,500 |
| UI/UX design | 6 days | ₹2,500 | ₹15,000 |
| Frontend development | 18 days | ₹3,000 | ₹54,000 |
| Backend and database development | 16 days | ₹3,500 | ₹56,000 |
| Testing and quality assurance | 10 days | ₹2,200 | ₹22,000 |
| Deployment and configuration | 3 days | ₹3,500 | ₹10,500 |
| Project coordination | 5 days | ₹3,000 | ₹15,000 |
| **Subtotal** | **63 person-days** | | **₹1,85,000** |
| Contingency reserve (15%) | | | ₹27,750 |
| **Estimated implementation cost** | | | **₹2,12,750** |

The 15% contingency covers likely rework, integration issues, and small requirement changes. Hosting, domain renewal, paid third-party services, and post-launch maintenance are excluded because providers and plans are unconfirmed.

### Effort distribution plot

Each block represents approximately one person-day.

```text
Requirements & analysis       █████                  5 days
UI/UX design                  ██████                 6 days
Frontend development          ██████████████████    18 days
Backend & database            ████████████████      16 days
Testing & quality assurance   ██████████            10 days
Deployment & configuration    ███                    3 days
Project coordination          █████                  5 days
                              ─────────────────────────────
Total                                                63 days
```

Frontend and backend development account for the largest estimated effort. These work areas should be monitored closely during implementation.

### Cross-check using other estimation approaches

- **Expert judgment:** approximately 60 person-days
- **Analogy estimation:** approximately 58–68 person-days, assuming a comparable small listing application
- **Bottom-up estimate:** 63 person-days
- **Size-based estimate:** requires a feature or function-point inventory and a productivity rate from comparable projects; without those inputs, a precise result would be misleading

These rough checks are close enough for an early plan. Bottom-up is the clearest budget basis because it exposes the work areas and assumptions. Revise the estimate after confirming actual features and implementation details.

## 6. Proposed six-week schedule

| Week | Planned activities | Main output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Confirm requirements, user roles, and scope. | Agreed feature list |
| 2 | Design screens, data model, and application structure. | Design and technical plan |
| 3 | Build candidate interface and core listing functions; start backend work. | First working features |
| 4 | Complete profile, search/filter, application, and administration functions. | Feature-complete build |
| 5 | Integrate components, test main user flows, and fix defects. | Release candidate |
| 6 | Final testing, deployment, documentation, and handover. | Deployed project |

Frontend and backend work can overlap once requirements and the data model are agreed. The schedule should be reviewed regularly because a delay in either stream can affect integration and testing.

## 7. Conclusion

No single technique is best at every stage. Top-down estimation and expert judgment are quick when requirements are incomplete. Bottom-up estimation gives a clearer task-by-task basis for budgeting. Analogy and size-based methods provide useful checks when comparable project data is available.

For Placement Finder, use **bottom-up estimation for the working budget**, **analogy or expert judgment as a cross-check**, and a **Gantt chart supported by dependency and uncertainty reviews** for scheduling. Under the assumptions in this report, the estimate is **63 person-days**, an implementation cost of **₹2,12,750 including contingency**, and a proposed duration of **six weeks**.
